\section{Moment Maps \& Symplectic Reduction}

\subsection{Moment Maps}

Suppose that $G$ is a Lie group with Lie algebra $\mf{g}$ that acts smooth on a symplectic manifold $(M,\w)$. For this talk, we shall assume that $G$ is also compact and connected (though this is not required for the definition of a moment map).

\begin{defn}
	Given a symplectic manifold $(M,\w)$ with a Lie group $G$ acting smoothly on $M$, the \emph{moment map} $\mu: M \rightarrow \mf{g}^{\ast}$ is a smooth map satisfying:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For each $X \in \mf{g}$, let
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\mu^{X}(p) := \langle \mu(p), X \rangle$, be the component on $\mu$ along $X$,
			\item $X^{\#}$ be the vector field on $M$ generated by the one-parameter subgroup $\{\exp(tX) \st t\in \RR  \} \subseteq G$.
		\end{itemize}
		Then
		$$
			d\mu^{X} = \imath_{X^{\#}}\w.
		$$
		\item $\mu$ is equivariant with respect to the prescribed $G$-action on $M$, and the coadjoint action $\Ad_{g}^{\ast}$ on $\mf{g}^{\ast}$, \ie
		$$
			\mu(g\cdot p) = \Ad_{g}^{\ast}\mu(p),\qquad \text{for all } g\in G,\text{ and } p \in M.
		$$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
	Consider $(\CC^{n},\w)$, where $\w$ is the standard symplectic form, $\w = \sum_{i=1}^{n}dz_{i}\wedge d\overline{z}_{i}$, and let the $n$-torus $T^{n} \cong (S^{1})^{n}$ act as	$t_{i} \cdot z_{i} \mapsto t_{i}z_{i}$. Then a moment map for this action is
	$$
		\mu(z) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(|z_{i}|^{2} + \lambda_{i}),\qquad \text{where } \lambda_{i} \in \RR.
	$$
	Here the coadjoint action on $(\mf{t}^{n})^{\ast}$ is trivial since $T^{n}$ is abelian, and (if we change to polar coordinates) also
	$$
		d\mu(r,\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}r_{i} dr_{i} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\imath_{\partial_{X_{i}}} r_{i} dr_{i} \wedge d\theta_{i} = \imath_{X} \w,
	$$
	where $X = (\partial_{\theta_{1}},\ldots, \partial_{\theta_{n}})$ is the vector field generated by the action.
\end{ex}

\begin{rmk}
	If we consider $N = \RR^{n}$ and $M = T^{\ast}N$, where the cotangent coordinates $p_{i}$ represent momentum and the base coordinates $q_{i}$ represent position, and let $SO(n)$ act on $M$ as rotations about the origin, then the moment map for this action is
	$$
		\mu(p,q) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} \times q_{i},
	$$
	which is the angular momentum of the system.
\end{rmk}

\subsection{Symplectic Reduction}

The properties of a moment map $\mu : M \rightarrow \mf{g}^{\ast}$ imply that is the stabiliser $G_{\alpha}$ of any $\alpha \in \mf{g}^{\ast}$ (with respect to the coadjoint action of $G$ on $\mf{g}^{\ast}$) preserves the level set $\mu^{-1}(\alpha)$, and that $\mu^{-1}(\alpha)$ is a submanifold of $M$ and the symplectic form $\w$ on $M$ induces a symplectic structure on the quotient $\mu^{-1}(\alpha)/G_{\alpha}$.

\begin{defn}
	The quotient $M_{\alpha} := \mu^{-1}(\alpha)/G_{\alpha}$ with the induced symplectic structure is called the \emph{Marsden-Weinstein reduction}, or \emph{symplectic reduction}. 
\end{defn}

One observes that if $\alpha = 0$, that is we reduce at the level zero so that the symplectic reduction is $M_{0}$, that the stabiliser of zero is the whole group $G_{0} = G$. Intermediately, if the action of $G_{\alpha}$ on $\mu^{-1}(\alpha)$ is not free, then the quotient $M_{\alpha}$ still exists but is likely to have singularities.

\begin{ex}
	Now consider $(\PP^{n}, \w_{FS})$, where $\w_{FS}$ is the Fubini-Study \K form on $\PP^{n}$,
	$$
		\w_{FS} = \frac{i}{2}\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{dz_{i} \wedge d\overline{z}_{i}}{(1 + \|z\|^{2})^{2}}.
	$$
	We let $S^{1}$ act on $\PP^{n}$ linearly via the representation
	$$
	\rho: S^{1} \longrightarrow \U(n+1),\qquad t \longmapsto \diag(t^{-1},t,\ldots, t),
	$$
	and the moment map for the action is
	$$
	\mu(z) = \frac{-|z_{0}|^{2} + |z_{1}|^{2} + \ldots + |z_{n}|^{2}}{\|z\|^{2}},\qquad z = [z_{0}:\ldots: z_{n}] \in \PP^{n}.
	$$
	Now a point $z \in \mu^{-1}(\xi)$ if and only if it satisfies
	$$
	(1+\xi)|z_{0}|^{2} = (1-\xi)( |z_{1}|^{2} + \ldots +  |z_{n}|^{2}),
	$$
	so $\mu^{-1}(\xi) = \emptyset$ if $\xi > 1$, and also if $\xi < 1$, then for $z \in \mu^{-1}(\xi)$ we have $z_{0} \neq 0$ and
	$$
	|z_{1}/z_{0}|^{2} + \ldots |z_{n}/z_{0}|^{2} = (1+\xi)/(1-\xi).
	$$
	Therefore $\mu^{-1}(\xi) \cong S^{2n-1}$ in $\CC^{n}$, and as $S^{1}$ is abelian (and $\mu$ is equivariant), the stabiliser of $\xi \in (\mf{s}^{1})^{\ast} \cong \RR$ is the whole group $S^{1}$. Thus the symplectic quotient is $\mu^{-1}(\xi)/\Stab_{S^{1}}(\xi) \cong S^{2n-1}/S^{1} = \PP^{n-1}$.
\end{ex}

This example was chosen to highlight that the symplectic reduction in this case can be identified the with the topological quotient of the dense open subspace $\CC^{n} \setminus \{0\} \subset \PP^{n}$ by the action of the complexification $\CC^{\ast}$ of $S^{1}$, \ie $\PP^{n-1} \cong (\CC^{n} \setminus \{0\})/\CC^{\ast}$.

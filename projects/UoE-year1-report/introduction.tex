\chapter{Introduction}

This is my report for the First Year Annual Review of my PhD at The University of Edinburgh. In this chapter, I will give a short overview of the other things I have done alongside my studies.

First of all, I was the First Year Postgraduate Representative for the School, a role that had more responsibilities tied to it than previous years with the introduction of the Bayes Centre, since now the whole of the first year cohort were based separately from the other students and academics in the department. My responsibilities included: being the medium through which feedback and suggestions would make their way to the Graduate School office, as well as the Head of School; organising the tea and coffee breaks at the Bayes Centre; assisting the other Postgraduate Representatives with the organisation of the Christmas party, as well as the Welcome Dinner for the new students.

There were also several Graduate Schools and Workshops that I attended throughout the year:
\begin{itemize}
	\item March 16th - 22nd 2019: There was both a graduate school and workshop at the SCGP titled `\emph{Challenges at the Interface of Hitchin Systems and String Theory}'.
	\item May 25th - 31st 2019: There was a graduate school at the SCGP titled `\emph{Graduate Summer School on the Mathematics and Physics of Hitchin Systems}'.
	\item June 24th - 28th 2019: The VBAC 2019 conference at the Sandbjerg Estate with the theme `\emph{GIT, Wall-Crossings and Moduli Spaces}'.
	\item July 29th - August 2nd 2019: There was a conference at the MPIM in Bonn titled `\emph{Integrability, Geometry and Moduli}'.
\end{itemize}
Each of these was an inspiring experience for me, as I got to meet many academics whose papers I have or will be reading, even if some talks were too advanced for me to actively engage in at the time.

In terms of courses, I took two distant learning ones: a SMSTC course `\emph{Algebraic Topology}' and also one from the TCC, `\emph{Combinatorial Algebraic Geometry}'. In addition to these courses, I also enrolled for two taught at Edinburgh, namely `\emph{Topics in Noncommutative Algebra}', and also `\emph{Interactions in Algebra, Geometry and Topology}'. Finally, I gave a lecture for the `\emph{Moment Maps}' working seminar, in particular on `\emph{Toric Symplectic Manifolds and the Delzant Construction}'. This latter talk is what has actually paved a way towards what my current postgraduate study is now on.

Finally, I am pursuing the teaching stream during my postgraduate study at Edinburgh, and over the second semester I tutored the `\emph{Calculus and its Applications}' workshops, as well as helped mark the exam scripts.
